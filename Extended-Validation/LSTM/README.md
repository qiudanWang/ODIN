Assignment for sentiment classification of the reviews from IMDB dataset: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
 
## Classifier

The classifier ```SentimentClassifier() ``` consists of:
```python
self.emblayer = nn.Embedding(self.config.VOC_SIZE, self.config.EMBED_SIZE)
self.lstmlayer = nn.LSTM(self.config.EMBED_SIZE, self.config.HIDDEN_SIZE ,batch_first=True)
self.linear1 = nn.Linear(self.config.HIDDEN_SIZE, 32)
self.relu = nn.ReLU()
self.linear2 = nn.Linear(32, 2)
```
### Embedding layer

The ```nn.Embedding``` layer in PyTorch is a layer that maps discrete categorical variables to continuous vector representations, known as "embeddings". It is commonly used in natural language processing and other text-based tasks to represent words as dense, continuous vectors, which are easier to work with than the one-hot encoded representations that are commonly used as inputs to traditional neural networks.

This model takes in a batch of sequences of word indices of shape ```(batch_size, seq_length)``` and passes them through the embedding layer to produce a batch of sequences of word embeddings of shape ```(batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim)```. 


### LSTM layer

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is able to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It is called "long short-term memory" because it can remember information for long periods of time, but it is also able to forget irrelevant information and keep the most important information.

An LSTM layer ```nn.LSTM``` in PyTorch consists of four different "gates", which control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell:

- The "input gate" determines which parts of the input to store in the memory cell.
- The "forget gate" determines which parts of the previous state to forget.
- The "output gate" determines which parts of the previous state to output.
- The "memory cell" stores the relevant parts of the input and the previous state.

At each time step, the LSTM layer takes in an input x and the previous hidden state h and updates the hidden state based on these gates and the memory cell. The updated hidden state is then output and used as the input to the next time step.
